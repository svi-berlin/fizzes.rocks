* Plugin promoted from 2015 by [WPGov.it](http://www.wpgov.it), open-source solutions developed for Italian government websites
* Italian community [Porte Aperte sul Web](http://www.porteapertesulweb.it)
* This plugin was originally developed by [Peadig](http://peadig.com/wordpress-plugins/eu-cookie-law/) in 2012.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload `eu-cookie-law` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the EU Cookie settings page
4. Go through the steps and hit update!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Shortcodes available =

You can block code in posts, pages and widget by wrapping it with these shortcode:
`[cookie] ... [/cookie]`
Parameters:
`[cookie height="100px" width="100%" text="Hi <b>WordPress</b>"] //My code [/cookie]`

To display the button to revoke consent (if cookies accepted) or accept cookies:
`[cookie-control]`

You can also revoke consent by adding **?nocookie=1** parameter to your url.
Ex. wordpress.org/**?nocookie=1** or wordpress.org/something/**?nocookie=1**

To display a list of active cookies on user client:
`[cookie-list]`

= PHP Functions available =
You can check the consent with:
`if ( function_exists('cookie_accepted') && cookie_accepted() ) {
    // Your code
}`

If you want to display the cookie-block message:
`generate_cookie_notice($height, $width);
generate_cookie_notice_text($height, $width, $text);

if ( function_exists('cookie_accepted') && cookie_accepted() ) {
    // Your code
} else {
	generate_cookie_notice($height, $width);
}`

Please note that **cookie_accepted** returns true if you disable it in the settings panel, if you excluded the current page or if you are a search engine :)

If you think that we should enhance something let us know in the [forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/eu-cookie-law).

= Javascript Filters =
Sometimes it could be useful to trigger custom actions on cookie consent, so we added useful filters.

If you want to play, just download our [sample plugin](https://plugins.svn.wordpress.org/eu-cookie-law/assets/eu-cookie-law-filter.zip) and start coding!


= Auto block =
The plugin offers an exclusive function that allows you to block **iframes, embeds, objects, and scripts** in posts, pages, and widgets. This can be activated in the plugin options panel because it is disabled by default.

To exclude a page from the filter set a custom post field **eucookielaw_exclude** to **1**. Just enable "Custom Fields" in "Screen Options" and in the "Custom Fields" box type the name, the value, and hit "Add Custom Field".

If you want to exclude a script, you can type between `<script>` and `</script>` the string **eucookielaw_exclude**.
Ex. add **class="eucookielaw_exclude"** or a comment.

= Cache =
We are working to improve cache compatibility. As for now, conflicts may occur.

**WP Super Cache** (sperimental*): open the file wp-content/advanced-cache.php and add the following immediately after <?php opening:
`if ( !isset( $_COOKIE['euCookie'] ) ){ return; }`

So that you have:
`<?php
if ( !isset( $_COOKIE['euCookie'] ) ){ return; }

function wpcache_broken_message() {`

= WPML =
This plugin is officially certified for WPML. You can translate every string with WPML's String Translation module.

WPML’s String Translation module is part of the Multilingual CMS package. To enable it, you first need to download and install it from your WPML.org account > Downloads section.

Then, go to **WPML->String Translation** and use the display filter, at the top of the String Translation page, to determine which strings to display.

Click on the translations link to open the translation editor and adjust the strings as you want. Be sure to click on "translation is complete"" after you translate. Incomplete translations will not appear on the site.

* Removed ability to serve inline scripts in the banner - Security fix for CVE: "By exploiting the documented vulnerability, an authenticated attacker with high privileges (admin) can execute JavaScript code in a victim's browser."
* Some personal thoughts about the CVE:
* EU Cookie Law allows for free HTML editing of the banner via the admin area to give better customization. This can be done only by a user with **manage_options** (=**admin** rights).
* Please note that this vulnerability had to be used by an **admin**.
* This update was released to reassure our users: we work to keep this plugin secure and efficient!
